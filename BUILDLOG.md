# BUILDLOG — every shipped release, in order

Written ONLY by `tools/record-release.sh`, after GitHub Actions has built, signed and
published a version — never by hand, never before that run is green. `ship.sh` and
`.github/workflows/android.yml` gate the next `versionCode` against this file: a line here is a
claim that a release EXISTS and is installable.

No releases yet.
