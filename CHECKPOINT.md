# CHECKPOINT 483 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-11-06T07:52:16Z · **tests:** all 3 fast checks green (gradle suite: see ship.sh)
**Branch:** `claude/new-session-7a9vpi` · **builds on:** `13b914b` (this checkpoint is the commit after it)

## Just done
gated v0.7.6 (code 23) and pushed it: the handoff self-test, the full unit suite + lint
and the versionCode check all passed here. NOT yet built - GitHub has not been asked.

## Do this next
TRIGGER THE BUILD: mcp__github__actions_run_trigger, method run_workflow, workflow
android.yml, ref main, inputs {"full_build": "true"}. When that run is green,
confirm the Release is published (get_release_by_tag is enough) and then run:
  bash tools/record-release.sh v0.7.6 "v0.7.6: lock-screen number now matches the stock one (bigger, Medium weight, lower) with size/weight/brightness steppers in Launcher control; lock screen stays quiet (no Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or app notifications); soft-edged lock-screen patch aligned per tablet; battery-saver cap/breaker and review fixes"

*(resuming? CLAUDE.md's "FIRST ACTION OF EVERY SESSION" comes before "Starting a session" — do that one first, or autosave stays off all session.)*

## Uncommitted right now
