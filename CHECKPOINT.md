# CHECKPOINT 310 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-11-05T05:02:35Z · **tests:** all 1 fast checks green (gradle suite: see ship.sh)
**Branch:** `ccr-3bcc29a7-cuz0x0` · **builds on:** `92a21c6` (this checkpoint is the commit after it)

## Just done
gated v0.7.0 (code 17) and pushed it: the handoff self-test, the full unit suite + lint
and the versionCode check all passed here. NOT yet built - GitHub has not been asked.

## Do this next
TRIGGER THE BUILD: mcp__github__actions_run_trigger, method run_workflow, workflow
android.yml, ref main, inputs {"full_build": "true"}. When that run is green,
confirm the Release is published (get_release_by_tag is enough) and then run:
  bash tools/record-release.sh v0.7.0 "v0.7.0: task-precise Recents clean-up at the lock (only Quickstep's own tasks go; apps both worlds use are spared unless they have a notification), keep-alive service for a faster unlock (default on, switch in Control), optional status-bar hiding in custom (off by default), safety audit with fixes, efficiency pass for the MT8168, notification-panel rules, phone guide 1.1 (every command line run in CI, compile undo fixed), Button Mapper and open-but-hidden research"

*(resuming? CLAUDE.md's "FIRST ACTION OF EVERY SESSION" comes before "Starting a session" — do that one first, or autosave stays off all session.)*
