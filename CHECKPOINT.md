# CHECKPOINT 93 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-11-02T20:19:15Z · **tests:** all 1 fast checks green (gradle suite: see ship.sh)
**Branch:** `ccr-4ff66321-chzhhg` · **builds on:** `b7f9a01` (this checkpoint is the commit after it)

## Just done
pre-ship: v0.2.3: return reset on double-Home (close apps, clear notifications, Wi-Fi/BT off, open Solitaire), more responsive twist gesture, faster power-menu cover

## Do this next
ship.sh gates and releases this

*(resuming? CLAUDE.md's "FIRST ACTION OF EVERY SESSION" comes before "Starting a session" — do that one first, or autosave stays off all session.)*

## Uncommitted right now
