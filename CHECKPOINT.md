# CHECKPOINT 322 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-11-05T07:01:46Z · **tests:** all 3 fast checks green (gradle suite: see ship.sh)
**Branch:** `ccr-888039cc-xwzdeh` · **builds on:** `338efa0` (this checkpoint is the commit after it)

## Just done
gated v0.7.1 (code 18) and pushed it: the handoff self-test, the full unit suite + lint
and the versionCode check all passed here. NOT yet built - GitHub has not been asked.

## Do this next
TRIGGER THE BUILD: mcp__github__actions_run_trigger, method run_workflow, workflow
android.yml, ref main, inputs {"full_build": "true"}. When that run is green,
confirm the Release is published (get_release_by_tag is enough) and then run:
  bash tools/record-release.sh v0.7.1 "v0.7.1: PhoneGuide 1.2 (short-cable plan: 3 parts, next-step button, ticks that stay); tablet report now holds the launcher's own state, a parser self-check, the side-key test (Power menu v2 readiness) and a short text summary (setup button 2b); tools/tablet-intake.sh saves it for Claude"

*(resuming? CLAUDE.md's "FIRST ACTION OF EVERY SESSION" comes before "Starting a session" — do that one first, or autosave stays off all session.)*

(3 automatic checkpoint(s) since the last deliberate one — the
session was still mid-step. `git diff` against it shows what changed.)
