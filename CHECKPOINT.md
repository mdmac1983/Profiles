# CHECKPOINT 201 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-11-04T02:32:42Z · **tests:** all 1 fast checks green (gradle suite: see ship.sh)
**Branch:** `claude/install-hooks-script-chvlig` · **builds on:** `5c6f4b7` (this checkpoint is the commit after it)

## Just done
gated v0.3.6 (code 12) and pushed it: the handoff self-test, the full unit suite + lint
and the versionCode check all passed here. NOT yet built - GitHub has not been asked.

## Do this next
TRIGGER THE BUILD: mcp__github__actions_run_trigger, method run_workflow, workflow
android.yml, ref main, inputs {"full_build": "true"}. When that run is green,
confirm the Release is published (get_release_by_tag is enough) and then run:
  bash tools/record-release.sh v0.3.6 "v0.3.6: new settings UI with real switches, separate Recents per launcher, quick-settings tiles per launcher, faster pencil cover, home-screen-only wallpaper patch with nudges, power-menu latency readout"

*(resuming? CLAUDE.md's "FIRST ACTION OF EVERY SESSION" comes before "Starting a session" — do that one first, or autosave stays off all session.)*
