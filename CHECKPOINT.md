# CHECKPOINT 666 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-11-08T03:46:42Z · **tests:** all 3 fast checks green (gradle suite: see ship.sh)
**Branch:** `claude/new-session-yhyifc` · **builds on:** `a3bc971` (this checkpoint is the commit after it)

## Just done
gated v0.8.8 (code 33) and pushed it: the handoff self-test, the full unit suite + lint
and the versionCode check all passed here. NOT yet built - GitHub has not been asked.

## Do this next
TRIGGER THE BUILD: mcp__github__actions_run_trigger, method run_workflow, workflow
android.yml, ref main, inputs {"full_build": "true"}. When that run is green,
confirm the Release is published (get_release_by_tag is enough) and then run:
  bash tools/record-release.sh v0.8.8 "pop-up notification banners are switched off while the custom launcher is in front and while the tablet is dark or locked (in any launcher), and are back as they were in an unlocked Quickstep session (new switch in Launcher control > Everyday); the tablet report now says which app posted a notification, when, and in which state (never what it says); the clean-up at the start of a custom session also looks in the shade when something was posted since the last one, even if no status-bar icon shows"

*(resuming? CLAUDE.md's "FIRST ACTION OF EVERY SESSION" comes before "Starting a session" — do that one first, or autosave stays off all session.)*
